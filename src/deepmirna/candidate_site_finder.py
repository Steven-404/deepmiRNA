# This file scans the 3'UTR of a given gene to find potential candidate sites to be passed to the
# neural network for evaluation. When the 3'UTR is particularly big the sequence is split in chunks
# and the candidates are searched using multiprocessing. The max number of cores to use is defined
# in the configuration file. A site is a candidate if has at least MIN_COMPLEMENTARY_NUCLEOTIDES
# and if the free energy released by the reaction with the given miRNA is below the
# FREE_ENERGY_THRESHOLD.
